# Many_Forms C#

*08/07/2020 is the recent updates to the codebase.*

-----
To code this project I used my skills in HTML and CSS languages, also my knowledge BEM technology.

Here you'll see:
* TreeView;
* TabControl;
* CSS Grid Layout;
* PictureBox;
* XML File in DataGridView.


My improving plan for this project is to Display Records from Database to DataGridView.

It's ready to review! :octocat:
